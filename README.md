# üçè Apple Stock Price Analysis and Prediction

This project explores **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** stock price data from Yahoo Finance to analyze historical performance and forecast future prices using Python. Alongside predictive modeling, it introduces and applies a variety of **financial concepts** and **technical indicators**.

## üìå Project Goals

- Analyze Apple's historical stock price trends
- Explore and apply financial indicators
- Build machine learning and time series models for forecasting
- Visualize market-moving events alongside price action
- Interpret results with respect to financial insights

---

## üß† Financial Concepts & Technical Indicators

This analysis covers a wide range of foundational and technical finance concepts:

- **Daily & Cumulative Returns**
- **Moving Averages (7-Day SMA/EMA)**
- **Bollinger Bands** ‚Äì for volatility and trend strength
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** ‚Äì for identifying overbought/oversold conditions
- **RSI Divergence** ‚Äì as an early signal for potential reversals
- **Buy/Sell Signals** based on RSI thresholds
- **Event Impact Mapping** ‚Äì overlaying stock events (launches, keynotes, macroeconomic news) on price charts

---

## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Historical stock prices were fetched using the `yfinance` library for the ticker symbol `AAPL`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Time series visualization
   - Volume vs price exploration
   - Event annotation on timelines

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Rolling mean/volatility
   - RSI computation
   - Bollinger Band levels
   - Lag features and shifted targets for modeling

4. **Modeling Techniques**  
   - **Linear Regression**
     - Used to predict future prices based on engineered features
     - Evaluated using RMSE and visual comparison
   - **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
     - Applied to model stock price time series
     - Useful for understanding autocorrelation and trends
   - *[LSTM or Prophet models can be added later for deeper forecasting]*

5. **Visualization**  
   - Trends, seasonality, and volatility explored via plots
   - RSI signals and buy/sell decisions visualized
   - Forecast vs actual line plots

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python 3
- **Data**: Yahoo Finance API (via `yfinance`)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì data handling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äì visualization
  - `scikit-learn` ‚Äì regression modeling
  - `statsmodels` ‚Äì ARIMA time series
  - `yfinance` ‚Äì stock data retrieval

## üìä Results Summary

- RSI strategy offered simple but interpretable trading signals
- Bollinger Bands and moving averages captured market volatility
- Linear regression predicted short-term price movements with reasonable accuracy
- ARIMA modeling showed autocorrelation in Apple stock trends
- Product events (like iPhone/Mac launches) visibly impacted price trends

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Integrate LSTM or Prophet for better sequence modeling
- Add Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and risk-adjusted metrics
- Deploy this as a Streamlit app for live stock data analysis
- Add portfolio-level metrics and simulate investment returns
